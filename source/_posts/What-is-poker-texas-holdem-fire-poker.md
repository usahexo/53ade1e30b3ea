#  What is poker texas holdem fire poker?

Texas holdem fire poker is a poker game variant that uses a five-card deck and allows players to use two of their pocket cards with three community cards to make the best possible five card hand.

# How to Play?

To begin, all players must place an ante. The dealer will then give each player two cards face down. After looking at their cards, players must decide whether to fold or place a bet of twice the ante. All remaining players are then shown the first three community cards, called the flop. Players now have the opportunity to either check (pass if no bet placed), bet, or raise. After all bets have been placed, the fourth community card is revealed, called the turn. Players now have another chance to bet, raise or fold. The last community card is revealed, called the river and betting concludes. The player with the best five card hand shown wins the pot.

# Winning Hands

There are many different winning hands in Texas holdem fire poker, but here are some of the most common: royal flush (Ace through 10 of same suit), straight flush (five consecutive cards of same suit), four of a kind (four cards of same rank), full house (three card of one rank and two of another), flush (five consecutive cards of any suit), straight (five consecutive cards not all in the same suit), three of a kind (three card of same rank) and two pair (two different pairs).
