#  Taxpayer losses top $50,000 in one night playing blackjack

The taxman has come out a big loser following a night of high-stakes blackjack at Crown Casino in Melbourne.

New figures show that taxpayers shelled out more than $50,000 in just one evening as players took to the card tables in the hope of winning big.

While the losses may sound like a good reason to avoid the casino, they actually spell good news for the state coffers. That’s because Crown Casino is one of Victoria’s biggest taxpayers, tipping millions of dollars into government coffers each year.

In the 2017/2018 financial year, for example, Crown paid $269 million in taxes and other charges. And that was on top of its $2.4 billion in revenue.

Victoria’s Treasurer Tim Pallas was quick to defend the casino, saying it played an important role in the state economy. “Crown Casino is one of Victoria’s most significant taxpayers and employers, delivering significant economic benefits to Victoria including jobs and tourism,” he said.

But not everyone is convinced that casinos are good for the community. There have been calls for Crown to pay more tax, with some arguing that it should be on a par with hotels and restaurants.

Whatever happens, it looks like taxpayers will continue to lose money at Crown Casino – at least for the foreseeable future!

#  IRS sees big profits in blackjack taxes

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is raking in the profits from blackjack taxes, and it’s all thanks to Uncle Sam’s 25% tax on winnings.

According to a recent report from the IRS, the government took in more than $1.5 billion in taxes from blackjack winnings in the fiscal year 2017. This accounted for a big chunk of the agency’s overall revenue, which totaled more than $6.2 billion last year.

The high tax on blackjack winnings is designed to discourage people from playing the game, and it seems to be working. The total amount of money wagered on blackjack has been declining for years, and it’s now down to just over $2 billion per year.

This presents a serious challenge for casino operators, who are forced to find new ways to bring in revenue. Many casinos are now turning to online gambling, which is exempt from the 25% tax on winnings.

This has led to a surge in online gambling revenue, which totaled more than $24 billion last year. The IRS is expected to collect close to $3 billion in taxes from online gambling this year, which will account for more than 10% of the agency’s overall revenue.

#  Did you report your gambling losses on your taxes?

If you gambled during the year, you may be able to deduct your losses on your tax return. To claim a deduction for gambling losses, you must itemize your deductions. You can only deduct the amount of losses that exceeds the amount of your winnings.

For example, if you had $2,000 in gambling winnings and $3,000 in gambling losses, you can only deduct $1,000 on your tax return. Keep in mind that you can’t deduct any gambling losses that were incurred in connection with horse racing, dog racing or other wagering activities.

You should report your gambling losses on IRS Form 1040, Schedule A. Be sure to include all of your gambling activity for the year on this form, including the date of each game, the name of the casino or other venue where you played, and the amount of your winnings and losses.

You may also want to keep documentation of your gambling activity, such as receipts from the casinos or racetracks where you played or canceled checks showing your losses. This documentation can help support your deduction if you are audited by the IRS.

#  50,000 people took a bath on blackjack this year

## How to Casino Bath
What is casino bath? Casino bath is a gambling term that stands for a situation in which a player gets blackjack and the dealer busts. This can lead to a very large payout for the player, if they are lucky.

## The Math of Casino Bath
The math behind casino bath is relatively straightforward. For example, if you have a $10 bet and the dealer has an ace up, then the dealer has a total of 16. If he then draws another card and busts, you would win $190 ($10 x 19).

Keep in mind that casino bath can also work in reverse – if you have a blackjack and the dealer does not bust, you would still lose your original bet. So it’s important to always gamble responsibly, and never bet more than you can afford to lose.

That said, if you are lucky enough to hit a casino bath, it can be a very profitable experience!

#  Tax man cometh: Gambling losses could mean big tax bill

For many people, gambling is a fun way to pass the time and potentially win some money. But for those who gamble compulsively, it can be a costly habit that leads to financial ruin.

In the United States, gambling losses are tax deductible. This means that individuals can subtract the amount they lost from their taxable income. However, recent changes to the tax code could mean that gamblers will have to pay taxes on their winnings, regardless of whether they report them or not.

This change could lead to some big tax bills for compulsive gamblers. For example, imagine that someone has a net loss of $10,000 from gambling in a year. Under the old tax code, they would have been able to subtract this amount from their taxable income, resulting in a tax savings of $1,500. However, under the new tax code, they would have to pay taxes on their winnings, even if they didn’t report them. This could lead to a tax bill of $2,500 – more than twice as large as the old bill.

Compulsive gamblers will need to be especially careful about how they report their gambling losses for 2018 and beyond. While there is still some uncertainty about how the new tax code will be implemented, it is likely that gambling losses will be treated more harshly under the new rules. Individuals should seek professional advice if they are concerned about how these changes might affect them.
