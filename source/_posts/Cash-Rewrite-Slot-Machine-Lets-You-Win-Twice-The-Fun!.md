Playing the Casino game Cash Rewrite can be both entertaining and profitable. To get the most out of this game, it helps to understand the different winning combinations and how they are scored.

There are basically three ways to win at Cash Rewrite: with normal symbols, with wild symbols, or with scattered symbols. The first two pay out when three or more of the same symbols line up on an active payline starting from the leftmost reel. The third type of win occurs when at least two scattered symbols appear anywhere on the reels awarding a prize multiplied by the total bet amount.

To maximize your chances of winning, it's important to know which symbol combinations payout the most. The highest paying normal symbol is the dollar sign, which pays 2,000 times your bet amount for five in a row. Other high paying symbols include the cherries (1,000x), bars (750x), and sevens (500x). The wild symbol substitutes for any other symbol to form winning combinations except for scattered symbols.

One thing to keep in mind is that you must have placed a bet on each of the 20 lines in order to qualify for a payout; winning combinations only occur on enabled lines. Also, be aware that some of the higher paying normal symbols can only appear on specific reels. For example, the dollar sign can only show up on reels one and five, while the cherries can show up anywhere apart from reel one.

Now that you understand how Cash Rewrite works, it's time to put these tips into practice and start winning big bucks!
