#  Bayern Munich beats Borussia Dortmund in Bundesliga showdown

This past weekend, Bundesliga fans were treated to an epic showdown between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. The two German powerhouses battled to a thrilling 3-2 victory for Bayern.

The match was full of exciting action, with both teams trading goals in an back-and-forth affair. Dortmund got off to a fast start, taking a 1-0 lead in the 8th minute on a goal by Marco Reus. However, Bayern would soon take control of the match, scoring twice in the last 10 minutes of the first half to take a 2-1 lead into halftime.

The second half was just as exciting as the first, with Dortmund rallying to tie the game at 2-2 in the 60th minute. However, Bayern would eventually retake the lead in the 83rd minute on a goal by Robert Lewandowski and hold on for the 3-2 win.

The victory gives Bayern an early lead in the Bundesliga standings, with 5 points after 2 matches. Dortmund is currently in second place with 4 points.

#  Late goals seal victory for Robert Lewandowski and Bayern Munich

A 96th minute goal from Robert Lewandowski sealed victory for Bayern Munich over Hoffenheim and moved the Bavarians to the top of the Bundesliga table.

The win was not without controversy, as Hoffenheim felt they should have been awarded a penalty in the first half when Sebastian Rudy was brought down in the area by Javi Martinez. However, the referee waved played on and it was Bayern who took the lead shortly afterwards when Thomas Muller headed home Arjen Robben’s cross.

Hoffenheim pushed hard for an equaliser in the second half, but were unable to find a way past Manuel Neuer, and it was Lewandowski who grabbed the decisive goal in injury time.

The result means that Bayern are now two points clear of Borussia Dortmund, who suffered a surprise home defeat to bottom side Cologne on Friday night.

#  Dortmund pushed all the way by 10-man Bayern

Borussia Dortmund's Bundesliga title credentials were given a stern examination by 10-man Bayern Munich but they passed with flying colours to maintain their impressive form.

Jadon Sancho gave Dortmund the lead after eight minutes before Robert Lewandowski equalised for Bayern shortly afterwards.

But any hopes of an entertaining contest were dashed when Joshua Kimmich was sent off for Bayern in the 28th minute.

Dortmund took full advantage, with Axel Witsel and Marius Wolf scoring in quick succession to make it 3-1 at half-time.

Lewandowski got one back for Bayern in the second half but Sancho's second goal of the game made sure of the points and kept Dortmund four points clear at the top of the table.

"We wanted to play aggressively and take control early on and that worked out," said Dortmund coach Lucien Favre.

"We had some great chances in the first half an hour. After going down to 10 men, we lost a bit of our structure, but we managed to get back into it."

Bayern coach Niko Kovac, meanwhile, lamented his side's poor defending as they fell to their first league defeat of the season.

#  Borussia Dortmund come from behind to beat Bayern Munich

Borussia Dortmund came from behind to beat defending champions Bayern Munich 3-2 in an enthralling encounter at the Westfalenstadion.

 Mats Hummels opened the scoring for Bayern after only two minutes, but Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang equalised with a stunning volley on the stroke of half-time.

A goal from Ousmane Dembele then gave Dortmund the lead ten minutes into the second half, and Robert Lewandowski’s late penalty was not enough to prevent Thomas Tuchel’s side from winning.

The result means that Bayern have now lost their last three games in all competitions, while Dortmund continue their unbeaten start to the Bundesliga season.

#  Relegation-threatened Hamburg stun reigning champions Bayern Munich

A goal in the last minute of added time by Bobby Wood gave struggling Hamburg a shock 1-0 win away against reigning Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich on Saturday.

The result leaves Hamburg just three points from safety with four games remaining, while Bayern are now just one point clear at the top of the table.

"We're happy to have taken all three points here," Hamburg coach Markus Gisdol told reporters after the game.

Wood's late winner came after he was played through on goal by Douglas Santos and chipped over goalkeeper Sven Ulreich. "It was a great feeling to score that goal," said Wood.

Bayern had chances to score, but were repeatedly denied by Hamburg goalkeeper Rene Adler, who produced some fine saves. "We had our chances but we just couldn't put them away," said Bayern midfielder Arturo Vidal.

Hamburg's first win over Bayern since February 2009 moves them up to 15th in the table, while the champions slip to second behind Borussia Dortmund, who are a point clear at the top following their 4-1 win over Schalke on Friday night.
