#  Syria: UN urges action to stop 'ethnic cleansing'

The UN has warned that the Syrian government is carrying out an "ethnic cleansing" campaign in the country's rebel-held province of Idlib.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a report to the Security Council that Damascus was seeking to conquer the area with a "scorched earth policy".

He said as many as 800,000 civilians could be displaced by an all-out government offensive on Idlib and its surroundings.

The UN has also voiced alarm over reports of Syrian government forces using chlorine gas on civilians in rebel-held areas.

A Syrian military offensive in Idlib, the last major stronghold of rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad, has drawn warnings of a humanitarian catastrophe from aid groups.

Turkey, which backs some rebel factions in the area, has threatened to launch a counter-attack if Assad's forces push too far into the province.

#  Russia vetoes UN resolution on Syria crisis

Russia has vetoed a United Nations resolution to investigate the chemical attack in Syria, amid accusations by the US and its allies that Moscow was complicit in the gas attack.

The resolution – which would have established a new investigative body to determine responsibility for chemical weapons attacks in Syria – failed to pass after receiving six votes in favour, and 11 against.

Russian UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said the proposed body was “fundamentally flawed”, and that it would only serve to further politicize the crisis.

“This is a puppet show,” Nebenzia said of the vote. “The conclusion is already made … The West will not forget this chemical attack.”

Syria’s ambassador Bashar Jaafari said his government welcomed the resolution, and accused unspecified countries of trying to use the vote to topple President Bashar Assad.

The UN Security Council has failed to pass a resolution investigating the recent chemical attack in Syria, after Russia vetoed the measure. The US and its allies have blamed Russia for complicity in the gas attack – a charge that Moscow denies.

The proposed resolution establishing a new investigative body into chemical weapons attacks in Syria received six votes in favour, but eleven countries voted against it, including Russia. Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia called the proposed body "fundamentally flawed", stressing that it would only serve to further politicize the crisis. "This is a puppet show," Nebenzia said of Thursday's vote at United Nations Headquarters in New York City. "The conclusion is already made … The West will not forget this chemical attack." 
Syria's ambassador Bashar Jaafari also spoke at Thursday's meeting, welcoming the resolution while accusing unspecified countries of trying to use the vote as a pretext for regime change. 

Though Damascus has denied involvement in last week's suspected sarin gas attack on civilians near Damascus – which killed dozens of people – Western powers say there is mounting evidence pointing towards Syrian government forces being behind it. 

In anticipation of a Russian veto at Thursday's UNSC meeting, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson cancelled his trip to Russia planned for later this month. "We will continue working with our partners to pursue accountability for those responsible for this barbaric act," Johnson said in a statement Wednesday evening. 

Thursday's veto means that any future decisions on how to handle allegations of chemical weapon use in Syria will now need consensus among all 15 members of the Security Council instead of just nine votes

#  UN Security Council rejects resolution on military strikes in Syria

The United Nations Security Council has narrowly rejected a resolution on military strikes in Syria, drafted by the United States. The resolution needed nine votes in favor but only got eight, with three countries — Russia, China and Bolivia — voting against it.

"It is our hope that this will be a tipping point," said U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley after the vote, "that others will join us."

Russian Ambassador to the U.N. Vassily Nebenzia said his country's veto was meant to avoid an escalation of the war in Syria. "We are not associating ourselves with terrorists," he said. "We are defending our sovereignty."

The vote followed days of heated rhetoric by U.S., British and French leaders, who accused the Syrian government of using chemical weapons on civilians in Douma, a suburb of Damascus. The attack killed at least 70 people, according to aid groups.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has denied using chemical weapons and said his military struck a rebel base where such weapons were stored.

President Donald Trump has said he would make a decision on military action within 48 hours, warning that missiles "will be coming." But after the Security Council vote, he tweeted that the U.S.'s relationship with Russia is worse than ever before and that "Mission Accomplished!" could be next for Syria.

#  Death toll in Syria reaches 100,000

The United Nations has released a report stating that the death toll in Syria has reached 100,000. The UN also reports that over 1.5 million people have been displaced since the beginning of the conflict.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says that at least 97,000 people have been killed in the violence, while UN officials say that the number could be as high as 110,000. The organisation also reports that 6.8 million people are in need of aid, while more than 2.5 million have fled the country.

Syria has been embroiled in a brutal civil war since March 2011, when government forces cracked down on protesters calling for President Bashar al-Assad to step down. Since then, the conflict has become increasingly sectarian, with rebel groups and militant organisations such as Isis battling against Assad’s regime and its allies.

#  Obama weighs options on how to respond to Syrian crisis

As the humanitarian crisis in Syria deepens, President Barack Obama is weighing his options on how to respond.

The administration has said it is considering a range of options, including targeted military strikes against government targets. But Mr. Obama has also said he wants to make sure he has the support of Congress and the international community before taking any action.

Administration officials have said that any military strike would be limited in scope and aimed at punishing the Syrian government for its alleged use of chemical weapons.

Officials say they are also exploring ways to provide greater support to the Syrian opposition, including through providing more weapons to rebel groups.

But analysts say it is unclear what impact a limited military strike would have on the ongoing civil war in Syria. And there are concerns that providing more weapons to the rebels could lead to even greater sectarian violence in the country.

President Obama is set to meet with his national security team on Saturday to discuss these options further.
