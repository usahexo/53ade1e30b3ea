#  When Did Showboat Come To Be Non Gambling? It's Been A Complicated Process

As a long-standing showboat casino, it's no secret that gambling has always been one of its main attractions. That being said, recent changes in management and ownership have led to a period of transition for the casino, which is now classified as non-gambling. While this shift may seem sudden, it's actually been in the works for some time.

The history of showboat casino can be traced back to the early 1990s, when it was first opened as a riverboat casino. At the time, gambling was still in its relative infancy in the United States, and casinos were seen as a new and exciting opportunity for players. Over the years, as gambling grew in popularity, so too did showboat casino. In fact, by 2008 it was one of the largest casinos in the country.

However, with the rise of online gambling and other forms of entertainment, casinos began to face competition like never before. In an effort to stay relevant and sustain its profits, showboat casino made the decision to become a non-gambling establishment. This shift has been met with mixed reactions from both players and employees alike.

On the one hand, many people feel that showboat casino is no longer worth their time without the lure of gambling. On the other hand, others argue that this change could be what saves the casino from closure altogether. Only time will tell which side is right.

In any case, those looking to visit showboat casino will still find all of their favorite table games and slot machines available to them. However, they will not be able to gamble on any of them. Instead, they can expect to find a variety of different entertainment options including concerts and events held at the venue itself.

#  Showboat Casino To Cease All Gambling Operations

The Showboat Casino in Atlantic City will cease all gambling operations on August 31, 2014. This announcement comes just a few weeks after another casino in Atlantic City, the Revel, filed for bankruptcy.

The Showboat casino was first opened in 1987 and has seen its share of good and bad times. The casino was originally owned by Donald Trump, but he sold it in 1995. It was later purchased by Caesars Entertainment Corporation in 2003.

In a statement released by the company, they said that the decision to close the casino was based on "the continuing challenging economic conditions in Atlantic City." They went on to say that the closure would "result in the termination of approximately 2,000 employees."

The Showboat is the second casino to announce that it is closing its doors this year. In February, the Atlantic Club Casino closed its doors after filing for bankruptcy.

#  When Will The Showboat Casino Close Its Doors For Good? 

Since it first opened in 1986, the Showboat casino in Atlantic City has been a popular destination for gamblers. But with the industry experiencing a decline in recent years, the Showboat faces an uncertain future. 

In August 2014, it was announced that the casino would close its doors for good on August 31st of that year. But after negotiations with union members, the closure was delayed until November 13th. 

Now, with just days left before the casino is set to close, there is still no clear indication of what will happen next. Some believe that the casino may reopen under new ownership, while others think it may be demolished and replaced with a new development. 

Whatever happens, it's clear that the Showboat is in trouble and that its days are numbered.

#  Non-Gambling Version Of Showboat Opens In Atlantic City

A new non-gambling version of the Showboat casino has opened in Atlantic City. This comes after the closure of four of the city's twelve casinos last year.

The new casino is called "Empress Casino" and is a partnership between Hard Rock International and the Morris Bailey Group. The casino will have 1,600 slot machines and 97 table games.

The reopening of the Showboat is seen as a positive sign for Atlantic City, which has been struggling in recent years. The city's casino industry has been hit hard by competition from casinos in other states.

#  Former Casino Hosts File Class Action Lawsuit Against Showboat

### Casino hostesses and other employees who used to work at Atlantic City's Showboat casino have filed a class action lawsuit against the casino, alleging they were not paid properly for their time.

According to the lawsuit, which was filed earlier this week in federal court, employees were not given Meal and Rest breaks, despite being required to work long hours. In addition, the employees say they were not compensated properly for overtime worked.

The plaintiffs are seeking back pay, damages, and attorney fees.

"My client and her fellow employees were not treated fairly by Showboat," said Matthew Luber of Langer, Grogan & Diver. "They deserve to be compensated for the hard work they did for the casino."

An Atlantic City casino spokesperson declined to comment on the pending litigation.
