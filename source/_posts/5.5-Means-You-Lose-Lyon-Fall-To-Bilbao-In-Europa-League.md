#  5.5 Means You Lose: Lyon Fall To Bilbao In Europa League

Aritz Aduriz’s early goal was the difference as Athletic Bilbao knocked out Lyon in the Europa League semifinals on Thursday.

The Spanish side advanced to the final with a 5-4 aggregate victory, after winning the first leg 3-1 in France.

Aduriz turned home Markel Susaeta’s cross in the fourth minute at San Mames, and Athletic held on to reach their first continental final since 1984.

Bilbao will face either Chelsea or Eintracht Frankfurt in next month’s final. The Germans hold a 1-0 advantage ahead of next Thursday’s second leg in London.

#  Bad Luck For Lyon As They Hit 5.5 Against Bilbao

Lyon went into their home game against Athletic Bilbao looking to make it six consecutive wins in all competitions and keep up their title challenge. However, they were undone by two very unlucky goals which put the Basque side 5-1 up after just 56 minutes.

The first goal, scored by Aritz Aduriz, came off the post and then in off the goalkeeper's head, while the second, a penalty from Iker Muniain, was awarded after replays showed that Lyon defender Marcelo had got the ball.

Lyon did pull one back through Alexandre Lacazette in injury time but it was little consolation on a frustrating night for Remi Garde's side. They are now five points behind league leaders Marseille and two behind PSG who occupy the second automatic Champions League qualifying spot.

 Things could have been different if striker Bafetimbi Gomis had not missed an early penalty but there is no doubt that Lyon were well beaten on the night. Garde will be hoping for a better result when they travel to Montpellier at the weekend.

#  Lyon notch up another unlucky 5.5 against Bilbao

Although Lyon’s 5.5 away match against Bilbao ended in a draw, the unlucky French side have now accumulated five losses and only one victory in their last six encounters. With star midfielder Nabil Fekir out injured, Hubert Azais’ troops showed great resilience but could not find the back of the net even after firing 27 shots on goal.

Bilbao, meanwhile, remain unbeaten in their last six home fixtures, with four clean sheets in the process. With veteran striker Aritz Aduriz still finding the back of the net on a regular basis, Unai Emery’s men will be looking to make it three wins in a row when they travel to Dijon next weekend.

#  Olympique Lyonnais stumble at 5.5 yet again

This season has seen Olympique Lyonnais be one of the more dominant teams in Europe. They sit atop Group F of the UEFA Champions League with a perfect record of five wins from five games, and are currently second in Ligue 1 – three points behind Paris Saint-Germain. However, they have recently hit a snag, as they drew their game against Strasbourg last week 1-1. This was their third consecutive draw in all competitions (the other two being also against Strasbourg), which has caused some alarm bells to start ringing.

As good as Lyonnais have been this season, their occasional inability to finish off teams when they have them on the ropes may come back to bite them later on in the campaign. In the Champions League, this might not prove too costly, but in Ligue 1 it could end up costing them the title.

This is not to say that Lyonnais are a bad team – far from it. They have some of the best players in Europe at their disposal and are more than capable of going all the way in both competitions this season. However, if they want to do so, they will need to start winning games by bigger margins, instead of relying on last-minute goals or draws to see them through.

Lyon 5 - Bilbao 1

In a stunning turn of events, Bilbao have come from behind to take the win 5-1 away at Lyon in their Europa League tie. The Spanish side started brightly, with Inaki Williams having the first chance of the game. However, it was Lyon who took the lead in the 18th minute when Memphis Depay scored from close range. Just before half-time, Bilbao were awarded a penalty which Williams duly dispatched to make it 1-1.

The second half was all Bilbao. They were rampant and two goals in three minutes from Aritz Aduriz and Markel Susaeta put them in control. The home side pulled one back through Depay but it was mere consolation as Susaeta completed his brace to seal an amazing victory for Athletic Club.
