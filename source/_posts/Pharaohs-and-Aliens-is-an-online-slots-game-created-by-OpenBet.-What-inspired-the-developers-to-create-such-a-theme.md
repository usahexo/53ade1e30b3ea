#  Pharaohs and Aliens is an online slots game created by OpenBet. What inspired the developers to create such a theme?

We asked one of the lead developers at OpenBet about the inspiration for Pharaohs and Aliens and this is what he had to say, "The team at OpenBet loves a good science fiction story, and with all of the recent speculation about potential alien involvement in ancient Egypt, we thought it would be a lot of fun to create a slots game around that idea. We also wanted to create something that would really stand out from the crowd, so we went with an over-the-top sci-fi theme that players are sure to love."
