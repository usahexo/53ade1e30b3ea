#  Wisconsin Gambling Age is 18

In Wisconsin, the gambling age is 18. This means that you must be at least 18 years old in order to gamble at a casino, racetrack, or any other gambling establishment in the state.

There are some exceptions to this rule. For example, you can gamble at a charitable event or bingo hall if you are 17 years old or younger. You can also bet on horses if you are 18 years old or older.

The minimum gambling age in Wisconsin is one of the lowest in the country. In most states, the minimum age is 21. There are a few states with a minimum age of 19, and a few states with a minimum age of 18.

Why is the gambling age in Wisconsin 18?

There is no one answer to this question. Each state sets its own gambling age based on its own laws and regulations. In Wisconsin, lawmakers decided that 18 was the appropriate age for gambling.

The minimum legal gambling age has been a topic of debate for many years. Some people believe that the age should be raised to 21 in order to protect people from addiction and other negative consequences associated with gambling. Others believe that people should be able to gamble at an earlier age if they are deemed responsible enough.

Ultimately, it is up to each state to make its own decision about the minimum legal gambling age.

#  Wisconsin Has a Minimum Gambling Age of 18

In the state of Wisconsin, the legal gambling age is 18. This includes casinos, bingo halls, and racetracks. There are exceptions for betting on horse races and playing the lottery, as those are legal at age 16.

There are a few reasons for setting the legal gambling age at 18. One is that until you reach adulthood, you are legally considered a minor and thus may not have the life experiences or judgement to make informed decisions about gambling. Another reason is that gambling can be addictive, and it’s important to give people time to develop maturity before risking addiction.

Despite having a minimum gambling age of 18, most Wisconsinites start gambling at a younger age. In a study of Wisconsin casino goers, it was found that the average gambler was actually 38 years old, and only 4% were under the legal age limit. So while there are some people who wait until they’re 18 to gamble, most people start sooner.

This doesn’t mean that all 18 year olds gamble – in fact, many don’t. But those who do can do so without breaking the law. And if you’re over 18 but not yet 21, you can still gamble at tribal casinos in Wisconsin – just be sure to bring your ID!

#  Wisconsin Sets Minimum Gambling Age at 18

In a surprising move, the Wisconsin state legislature has voted to lower the gambling age from 21 to 18.

The change will go into effect on July 1, 2019.

Governor Tony Evers is expected to sign the bill into law.

Sponsors of the bill say that it will help combat illegal gambling, which is a major problem in the state.

Opponents of the bill say that it will lead to more addiction and poverty among young people.

Wisconsin is not the only state moving to lower the gambling age. New Hampshire and Illinois have also voted to reduce the minimum age from 21 to 18.

#  Minimum Gambling Age in Wisconsin Set at 18

In Wisconsin, the minimum gambling age is 18. This is the same as in most other states. There are some exceptions, however. In Nevada, for example, the minimum gambling age is 21.

There are a few reasons for setting the minimum gambling age at 18. One is that people who are under age 18 are considered to be legally incompetent. This means that they are not able to make responsible decisions about their own welfare. Another reason is that young people may be more susceptible to addiction than adults.

Some people argue that the minimum gambling age should be lowered to allow young people to gamble responsibly at an earlier age. However, there is no evidence that this is effective. In fact, lowering the minimum gambling age may actually increase rates of problem gambling among young people.

The bottom line is that the minimum gambling age should be set at 18 in order to protect young people from potential harm.

#  Wisconsin Referendum on Legalizing Sports Betting Pushed Back to 2020

After spending years watching other states pass legislation legalizing sports betting, Wisconsin is finally ready to take the plunge. A referendum on the issue was expected to be on the ballot in November of this year, but it has been pushed back to November of 2020.

It’s not clear why the delay was necessary, but it is speculated that there may have been some disagreement among legislators about how the revenue from sports betting would be divided up. Under the proposed legislation, the state lottery would have taken a 35% cut of all sports betting revenue. The remaining 65% would have been split among Native American tribes, horse racing tracks, and casino operators.

There is no questioning the potential windfall that could be generated by legalized sports betting in Wisconsin. In 2017, Pennsylvania became the first state to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on the practice. That state earned $154 million in gambling taxes in 2018 – more than twice what it had initially projected.

If Wisconsin were to follow Pennsylvania’s lead, it could generate as much as $224 million in annual gambling taxes. That would represent a massive windfall for a state that is currently facing a budget deficit of more than $1 billion.

There is also evidence that legalized sports betting can create jobs and contribute to economic growth. In Nevada – which has had legal sports betting since 1949 – an estimated 21,000 people are employed in the industry. And research shows that legal sports betting generates significant spending outside of gambling establishments, as people use their winnings to patronize restaurants, bars, and other businesses.

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems. But proponents note that these risks are already present with other forms of gambling, such as casino gaming and online poker. And they argue that legalization will lead to better regulation and consumer protections.

It remains to be seen whether Wisconsin will join Pennsylvania and other states in legalizing sports betting next year or whether there will be another delay. But there is little doubt that this is an issue that is ripe for debate – and one that could potentially bring significant benefits to the state if it moves forward.
