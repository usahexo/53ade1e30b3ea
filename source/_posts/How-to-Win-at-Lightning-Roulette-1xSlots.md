Like all casino games, luck is a big factor in lightning roulette – but that doesn’t mean you can’t give yourself a bit of an edge. By studying the odds and patterns associated with each number, you can make more informed guesses about where the ball will land.

4. Look for Tables With Low Betting Limits

Not all tables have the same betting limits, so it’s important to find one that suits your budget. If you want to bet high stakes, look for tables with high betting limits; alternatively, if you want to play safe, choose a table with lower betting limits.
